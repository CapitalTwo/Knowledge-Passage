# Knowledge-Passage

This is the one to generate the knowledge passages located at https://knowledge.capitaltwo.ga. It contains some models I modified so it fits our project. 

### Run

This one using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). To run this one locally, do: 

```bash
npm install hexo-cli -g # install hexo
git clone https://github.com/CapitalTwo/Passage-Generator.git --recursive
cd Passage-Generator
npm install
hexo server 
```

Then you will be able to look it on your local machine. 

<mark>Notice: Some links on website are absolute links direct to capitaltwo main website. You may want to forward consigured those site appropriatly before executing, including referring. </mark>

Some parts might not be accurate.
